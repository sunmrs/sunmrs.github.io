    <h1>How Does Christainity Influence Marriage? </h1>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>Marriage in Christianity is expressed as a covenant; also known as an agreement between God and the sacred bond between a man and a woman. Since marriage is a contract through God, the marriage must follow the five principles:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> The permanence of marriage: Marriage is suppose to be permanent. Divorce is not permitted except in a very limited number of biblically prescribed circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>  The sacredness of marriage: Marriage is not merely a human agreement between two consenting individual, but it is a relationship before and under God.
        </li>
        <li>  The intimacy of marriage: Marriage is the most intimate of all human relationships, uniting a man and a woman in a "one-flesh" union. Marriage involves "leaving" one's family of origin and "being united" to one's spouse, which signifies the establishment of a new family unit distinct from the two originating families.
        </li>
        <li>  The mutuality of marriage: The marriage partners are to be first and foremost concerned about the wellbeing of the other person and to be committed to each other in steadfast love and devotion. This involves the need for forgiveness and restoration of the relationship in the case of sin.
        </li>
        <li>  The exclusiveness of marriage: No other human relationship must interfere with the marriage commitment between husband and wife. For this reason, Jesus treated sexual immorality of a married person, including even a husband's lustful thoughts, with utmost seriousness. Premarital sex is unlawful because it degrades the exclusive bond between man and woman. 
        </li>
      </ol>
