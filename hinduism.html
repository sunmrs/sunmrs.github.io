    <h1>How Does Hinduism Influence Marriage? </h1>
    <p>Views on Marriage: Buddhist texts do not actually state any sort of guidelines pertaining to marriage, however the Buddha did give advice concerning how to lead a happily married life.  He taught about about the downfall of man is not being loyal to their partner and to be content with your partner. The religion as a whole tho does not consider marriage holy or unholy, but rather a social obligation.<br><br><br><br>Views on Divorce: Divorce is allowable to Buddhism followers though it would be considered rare amongst devote followers.  Buddha also spoke against men having a much younger wife as this often causes marriages not to work in the long run.  Followers also believe that there should be equality amongst the sexes and neither man nor woman should think of themselves above the other but rather equal. A famous monk named Ven. K. Sri Dhammanda (Pictured below) is quoted in saying “if a husband and wife really cannot live together, instead of leading a miserable life and harboring more jealousy, anger and hatred, they should have the liberty to separate and live peacefully.”
