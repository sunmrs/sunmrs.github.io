    <h1>How Does Islam Influence Marriage? </h1>
    <p>Islam marriage is unique in itself as it is a binding contract as opposed to being a traditional ceremony of two people coming together. When a man and women get married in Islamic marriages, they are agreeing to all of the rules, rights, and responsibilities that come up in a marriage. All of these are stated in their binding contract. The groom and a guardian of the bride must agree and sign the contract. The guardian of the bride is usually a male relative: the father, brother, uncle, etc. and they must be Muslim as well. This means that the bride cannot sign the contract of her own marriage. In most cases the consent of the bride comes from her not speaking. However in different parts of the world, the bride is able to sign the contract along with the guardian and the groom</p>

      <ol>
        <li>There are some qualifications needed before a marriage can take place for Islamic practices. As stated earlier, a contract is needed for the wedding to take place.
        </li>
        <li>The Quran has a few statements about how marriage must be seen to stay within the Islamic faith. Marriage is a key to one's faith in Islam, as it is a significant event in one's life and is the basis for how one carries themselves out to the world.
        </li>
        <li>In Islamic marriages there are still strict guidelines in the duties of the bride and groom. As the groom is expected to work and provide for the family.
        </li>
        <li>In Islamic marriages, a woman that find her husband not carrying out his duties stated in their marriage contract is guided to try for a divorce.
        </li>
        <li>Another significant difference in Islamic marriages is that men are able to have multiple wives or to practice polygyny.
