    <h1>How Does Judaism Influence Marriage? </h1>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>The Torah provides very little guidance with regard to the procedures of marriage.  Most things like the method of finding a spouse, the form of the wedding ceremony, and the nature of the marital relationship are all explained in the Talmud.  Judaism believes in bashert, or the idea of soul mates.  According to the Talmud, Rav Yehuda taught that 40 days before a male child is conceived, a voice announces from heaven whose daughter he is going to marry.  However, there are some statements in the Talmud that some say contradict the idea of bashert, such as the many bits of advice on picking a wife.  Nevertheless this belief still holds strong in the Jewish community.  The marriage process occurs is two different stages.  The first stage is kiddushin, commonly translated as betrothal, occurs when the woman accepts the money, contract or sexual relation offered by the hope to be husband.  Once kiddushin is complete the woman is legally the wife of the man and can only be broken by death or divorce.  The couple does not live together during the time of kiddushin and the mutual obligations created by the marital relationship do not take effect until the nisuin is complete.  Nisuin is the second stage and completes the process of marriage.  This stage consists of the husband bringing the wife into his home.  It is customary for the bride and groom to not see each other for a week before the wedding.  Also, traditionally the bride and groom fast the day before the wedding.  Before the wedding ceremony the bride is veiled in remembrance of Rebecca veiling her face when she was first brought to Isaac to be his wife.  Marriage is a very important part of the Jewish religion.  It is not considered holy to refrain from marriage like some other religions.  It is actually considered unnatural.  The Talmud states that an unmarried man is constantly thinking of sin.  According to the Torah and the Talmud a man can marry more than one wife, but a woman can only marry one man.  Polygyny is allowed but has never been common in this religion. </p>
